## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Boardroom is a DAO discovery and governance platform, home to hundreds of communities shaping the future of the ownership economy. Our current interface implementation was built to closely mirror the governance process of any DAO or distributed community, regardless of what governance framework they are built on.

**This grant will support the onboarding and ongoing maintenance of the Radicle governance dashboard on the new version of the Boardroom application, the integration into the Boardroom API, and meta governance efforts to increase participation from governors in other communities.** 

The **dashboard** will provide a powerful tool for Radicle governance participants to:

- Set up a global governance profile tracking all their activity
- View upcoming proposals and sign up for notifications on their user dashboard
- Browse through all active and closed Radicle proposals and voter information
- Vote and delegate (if enabled) on any proposal using any wallet
- Create proposals through a standardized and templatized interface
- Browse additional project treasury information and relevant resources

TheÂ API and SDKÂ allow any third-party interface and project to support Radicleâ€™s governance with one seamless integration. Support will be immediately available to anyone already using the Boardroom API.

In addition to the frontend and API integrations, Boardroomâ€™s **meta governance pod** aims to form an internal governance collective to delegate votes received as a service provider to a delegate that we believe upholds the values and ideals of the Boardroom community. As a holder of Radicle governance tokens, the Boardroom governance collective will actively participate and engage in the protocols that Boardroom supports.

### Goal

The goal of the integration is to increase transparency and external stakeholder input into the Radicle governance process. The Boardroom application can provide a single source of information and truth for the grants process, adding a level of disclosure and community participation that will create context and traceability for future proposals. The API also allows any third-party interface and application to easily access Radicle DAO data, governance, and participation information.

The second goal is to establish Boardroom as an involved meta governance participant in the Radicle ecosystem, aligning incentives between both communities, and pushing Boardroomâ€™s mandate for transparency and investment in governance tooling by the DAOs we support.

### Team's experience

Boardroom was started as a hackathon project in 2018 by Kevin Nielsen who would carry the idea into a role at TQ Tezos, where he built governance tooling for validators and token holders. The Boardroom founding team soon realized that if projects at the application layer were to adopt governance systems at scale, it would be important to abstract procedural complexities using aggregated governance tooling and services - so they started hacking on Boardroom a year and a half ago. Since then, it's grown to add an amazing team of seven engineers and developers that are passionate about building the future interface and architecture for distributed work, capital, and coordination.

The grant author (Michael Das) is a BizOps and Strategy Associate at Coinbase. At Coinbase, Michael expands products to international markets and builds tooling to enable future international growth. He is assists Boardroom with identifying and applying for protocol grants to facilitate onboarding and integrations for the new application, and will be the point of contact for this submission.
